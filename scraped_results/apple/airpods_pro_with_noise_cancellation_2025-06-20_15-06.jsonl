I have tried the airpod Max at the Apple Store and I thought the noise cancelling was excellent and as I was looking into it I also found the Airpod Pro has noise cancelling. Considering there is a huge price difference between the two all I really care about is the noise cancelling so if anyone can tell me if there's really much of a difference in noise cancelling or even if there's a better alternative from a different brand (Yes I know I shouldn't ask this in an Airpods subreddit) That would be great and I would really appreciate the help", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/1d8mtpm/how_are_the_airpod_pros_noise_cancelling_compared/", "source": "reddit.com", "price": "", "rating": ""}
