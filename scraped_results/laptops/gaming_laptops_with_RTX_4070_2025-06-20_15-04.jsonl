{"title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "summary": "", "full_text": "Like many people I see on here I am keeping my eyes peeled for a sub-$1k (in the US) RTX 4070 machine. From poking around the internet it seems to me that there are maybe 5-6 laptops that could fall that low depending on the sale. I\u2019m curious to know how you all would rank them. The 5 that I\u2019ve seen are: Lenovo legion 5 (slim) Asus rog zephyrus Asus tuf Msi katana Hp victus I\u2019ve listed those from best to worst based on my research because the Lenovo seems to have a better screen than the rest, with the possibility of a cheap upgrade to 240 hz, the rog seems to be mostly respected, the tuf lives up to its name, the Msi quality is maybe better on pricier machines and more hit or miss on their cheaper ones, and hp is hp, although people seem to like the victus. Just curious about whether you folks agree with this list, or whether there are other laptops I\u2019m not considering, or if there are other considerations I\u2019m unaware of that would influence these rankings.
