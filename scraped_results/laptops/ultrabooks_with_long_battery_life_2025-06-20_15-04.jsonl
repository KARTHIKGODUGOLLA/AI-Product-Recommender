This premium\u00a0workstation is the one to get if you want the best overall user experience or need a powerful device for highly demanding tasks.", "full_text": "For those on a tighter budget, we recommend the ASUS Vivobook 16 M1605 (2023), a 16-inch Windows ultraportable. While its battery life isn't as impressive as the other picks on our list, it'll last around eight hours of light use throughout the day. This model is all plastic, but it feels sturdy and is easy to carry around despite its size. You can configure it with an AMD Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 CPU, which are more than adequate for everyday tasks like web browsing or video playback. While its standard 8GB of RAM configuration can be a bit limiting, models with 16GB are available through some retailers, or you can add more yourself since the RAM is user-replaceable. The overall user experience is good. It has a comfortable keyboard, a large, responsive touchpad, and a decent 720p webcam. Its 1080p display looks reasonably sharp, and at 16 inches, it's a great size for general productivity work or media consumption; however, it isn't the brightest, so visibility may be an issue in well-lit rooms. You get Wi-Fi 6E wireless connectivity, a fingerprint sensor for quick logins, and a decent port selection with three USB-As, a USB-C, and an HDMI. Unfortunately, the USB-C doesn't support video output, so you'll have to use the HDMI port to connect an external display.", "url": "https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/best/battery-life", "source": "rtings.com", "price": "$500", "rating": ""}
