It packs a ridiculous amount of processing power and provides among the best user experiences available.", "full_text": "If you want a more affordable option, check out the Acer Swift Go 14 (2024). This thin, light productivity laptop is a solid option that provides a great user experience without the high price tag of premium models from brands like Dell, Microsoft, or Apple. It features the latest Intel Meteor Lake CPUs, which are powerful enough to handle tasks like text processing, web browsing, spreadsheets, and presentations, as well as more demanding workloads like programming and simulation. You can get up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage; unfortunately, only the latter is user-replaceable, so ensure you get enough RAM for your needs upfront. The build quality is great. Though not as rigid as an Apple MacBook Air 15 (M4, 2025) , it feels sturdily built, exhibiting only a small amount of flex on the lid and keyboard deck. You can choose between an FHD+ IPS or a 2.8k OLED panel for the display\u2014both look sharp and get bright enough to combat glare in most indoor settings. Of course, the OLED display will provide a better visual experience, but remember that it's susceptible to permanent burn-in and will drain the battery faster. The keyboard feels spacious, albeit slightly mushy, and the touchpad is large and responsive. You get Wi-Fi 6E wireless connectivity, a 1080p webcam, and a wide port selection that includes two Thunderbolt 4s and an HDMI. Its battery life is excellent at around 11 hours of light use\u2014you can charge the laptop via USB-C.", "url": "https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/best/by-usage/programming", "source": "rtings.com", "price": "$500", "rating": ""}

This, after all, is a device capable of professional-grade photo and video editing. Better still, you can boot it in Windows, too, giving you a bit more flexibility. The latest version packs an M4 Pro processor, which we found offered incredible performance over comparable laptops. In tests, Geekbench 6.3 numbers easily exceeded those of our MacBook Air M3. Image editing was a breeze, but while the laptop handled editing four 4K 30fps at once, we noted frame-rate drops when we bumped that to 4K 120fps video clips shot on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. As such, the M4 MacBook Pro shouldn't have any issues running programming applications. If you prefer a larger screen, check out our Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro, 2024) review . Alright, the design is the same as the last version, but why break what's not broken? Overall, we found the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch delivers breathtaking power, portability, and an XDR display with 1600 nits peak brightness. Port selection is good, including an SD card slot, an HDMI port, and three Thunderbolt 4 ports.
