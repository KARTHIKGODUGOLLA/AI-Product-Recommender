{"title": "The 6 Best Travel Laptops of 2025 - RTINGS.com", "summary": "The best travel laptop we've tested is the Apple MacBook Pro 14 (2024). This premium model has a remarkably sturdy build, a compact design, and a 15-hour battery life in light uses, making it perfect for on-the-go use.", "full_text": "If your workload consists mainly of general productivity tasks like text processing, web browsing, spreadsheets, and video playback, get the Apple MacBook Air 13 (M4, 2025) instead. Lighter and more compact, it's even easier to carry around than its Pro sibling. You get the same premium build quality as the Pro, as well as the same tactile keyboard, haptic touchpad, and 12MP webcam with Center Stage support. Performance aside, the downgrades from the Pro concern the display and port selection. Its Retina screen has a lower contrast ratio and refresh rate than the Pro's Mini LED, meaning the blacks don't look as deep, and inputs feel a little less responsive. As for ports, you only get two USB-Cs. Get the Apple MacBook Air 15 (M4, 2025) if you want a bigger screen. It's the same device, just with better-sounding speakers. For Windows users, we recommend the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition 15 (2024) . Although it's larger than the Apple MacBook Air 13, this is still a very compact device that's easy to carry. Plus, its battery life is even better, lasting around 17 hours of light use. It has a sharp 120Hz display, a slightly better port selection with the inclusion of a USB-A and MicroSD port, and Wi-Fi 7 wireless connectivity. Performance isn't a problem, but know some programs might not run or perform poorly because the laptop uses an ARM-based SoC, so make sure to check that the apps you use regularly will work. The Surface Laptop is more expensive than the MacBook Air, costing $300 USD more for the same configuration. If budget is a concern, check out its 13-inch sibling , which we haven't tested but expect to be very similar.", "url": "https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/best/travel", "source": "rtings.com", "price": "$500", "rating": ""}
{"title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "summary": "", "full_text": "Hey all, I'm currently lugging around a Dell XPS 15, which is around 4lb. It's not very onebagger-like, but I also often carry around an 11\" iPad on trips. The iPad is for random work I want to get done, drawing and writing with a stylus, movies, and ebooks. Because of the laptop/tablet combo, my single 30L bag can get quite heavy. I don't do anything too intensive on my laptop, so I'm looking to downgrade. I mainly use it for browsing, photo editing (Adobe Lightroom), and coding (nothing super intensive). I know there's a lower limit to the weight of a laptop, but I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions on lightweight laptops? I'm not picky on the screen size, but 13-15\" is ideal. I also need it to run Windows because of the coding, unfortunately. I have a feeling that I'll get suggestions of getting a Surface Pro (or adjacent) and leaving out the iPad on trips. I've debated a Surface Pro, but I have a few concerns. How well does the stylus work for writing notes? How does it do if you split screen with a notes app and a browser? Also, I sometimes use my laptop in conjunction with my tablet, but I would potentially sacrifice doing that for sake of weight saving. Also, how well does using the Surface on your lap work (ex. on trains or buses)? Is it uncomfortable? Does the keyboard ever get dislodged? How uncomfortable would it be to use the Surface for reading an ebook?

Of course, the Air was already a compact powerhouse with one of the most portable designs you can buy. This year's model carries through Apple's penchant for snappy performance, optimized connectivity, and impressive battery life. When all that comes in a quiet, fanless, and full-metal chassis, it's an easy pick for the best ultraportable MacBook.
