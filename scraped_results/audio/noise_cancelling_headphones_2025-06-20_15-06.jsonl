{"title": "The 4 Best Noise-Cancelling Headphones of 2025 | Reviews by Wirecutter", "summary": "Whether you prefer over-ear or in-ear noise-cancelling headphones, we have recommendations to help bring peace to your next trip.", "full_text": "We\u2019ve tested more than 300 pairs of headphones for this guide. That\u2019s a lot to cover, so we focus below on the newest and most high-profile competitors. However, if you\u2019re curious about a specific model, we\u2019ve archived many of our previous testing notes in a spreadsheet . Over- or on-ear headphones 1More SonoFlow : This pair is our former budget headphones pick. The noise cancellation is effective, but it was bested by that of the Soundcore Space One headphones. The sound quality is pleasant and adjustable, and the design is lightweight and comfortable, though not as sturdy-feeling as the Space One. The 50-hour battery life with ANC on (70 hours with it off) is impressive for a model in any price range. However, the ANC does not work in wired mode, so if you\u2019re on a plane that requires a wired connection to the in-flight entertainment system, you\u2019ll have to either go without ANC or pick up a Bluetooth transmitter . 1More Sonoflow HQ51 : This pair has strangely positioned controls, middling noise cancellation, and a muffled transparency mode. The pair we tested had an offensively strong plastic or chemical odor when we took it out of the box. 1More SonoFlow SE : A bare-bones edition of the SonoFlow, this set has similar battery life/quick-charge capabilities, app-adjustable tuning, and a lightweight design. But the SE lacks the water resistance, software-driven noise-cancelling microphone, and ability to listen wired. The noise cancellation doesn\u2019t sound as effective as the original, and we noticed that facing the source of a noise resulted in less reduction than when we turned to the side. The hear-through mode sounds muffled, but the microphone does a good job of reducing background noise for phone calls. If you want to spend the least amount possible for decent ANC headphones, this pair is light and comfy, sounds good, and reduces some noise, but we think spending a bit more for our budget pick is worth it for the extra functionality. Baseus Bowie 30 Max : The noise cancellation was average, but the sound was inconsistent\u2014the balance changed when we turned the ANC on and off. Whichever way you listen, this pair can\u2019t play very low notes: In our tests, the range from 20 to 35 Hz was just a toneless thump, and the bass level from 35 to 80 Hz was very low in volume. Beats Studio Pro : For every positive, this pair has an equally disappointing downside. The noise cancellation and hear-through modes sound great, but neither is adjustable. It\u2019s easy to use the larger physical buttons, but the power/ANC toggle button is inexplicably small. The foam earpads are soft but not replaceable. Android users get a dual-device connection feature; Apple users do not. There are three EQ settings, but they\u2019re only accessible when listening via USB-C. But most importantly, the sound quality is dramatically impacted by use of the spatial audio: When it\u2019s turned on, the lower bass is emphasized, and higher-pitched sounds have an artificial sharpness. With spatial audio off, the bass is notably diminished. Bose QuietComfort Headphones : These are good headphones, but they aren\u2019t remarkable enough to justify the $350 price. The ANC is not as effective as what the rest of the current Bose line can deliver. In fact, at the highest intensity, these headphones reduced less noise in the airplane band than our budget pick. Despite this, the amount of reduction is still effective and useful, and the ANC intensity is adjustable. The build is very comfortable, with a lightweight feel and squishy earpads that should accommodate many glasses arms. These headphones utilize physical buttons rather than the touch controls, and the buttons are easy to learn and find. The hear-through mode sounds natural, and music sounds good, albeit slightly bass-forward out of the box. The Bose app provides an EQ feature that can adjust the tuning, but it consists of only three faders, which is too simplistic. The microphones sound very clear in a quiet room, but background noises in the human vocal range, like a sink running nearby, will be pronounced. We love that Bose includes a cable with a three-button remote and mic\u2014a rare old school nicety. Cambridge Melomania P100 : This pair provides above-average noise cancellation\u2014an average of 19 dB of reduction. We like the powerful bass, the superb clarity for phone calls, and the option to use comedian Matt Berry \u2019s voice for system alerts. Out of the box, the low notes were too intense for our taste, and the high frequencies had a slight whistle-like quality to them, but after we made some adjustments to the app\u2019s EQ settings, the P100 sounded really great. What we didn\u2019t like was that the P100\u2019s build is on the heavier side, and its case is sizable\u2014making it tougher to fit in a bag. With phone calls, the side tone sounds as though your voice is coming through a paper-towel tube, and we wish that there was a way to disable the auto-play feature. These are minor flaws, but they were enough to keep this pair fro", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/", "source": "nytimes.com", "price": "$500", "rating": ""}
