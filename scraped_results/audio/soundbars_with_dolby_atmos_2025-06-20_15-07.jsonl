The best Dolby Atmos soundbar period Specifications Connectivity: HDMI out (eARC), wi-fi, Bluetooth 5.3, AirPlay 2 Sound format support: Dolby Atmos Streaming: Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect Voice control: Sonos Voice Control, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant Dimensions (hwd): 7.5 x 118 x 11 cm Weight: 10kg Reasons to buy + Clean, precise, spacious and three-dimensional sound + Deep, tuneful and expressive bass + Terrifically detailed for a soundbar Reasons to avoid - No HDMI passthrough - No DTS support - Still some app issues The Sonos Arc Ultra is the new flagship Dolby Atmos soundbar from the iconic audio brand. Based on our thorough comparative testing it is also the best overall option for most people. At a technical level it is an impressive piece of hardware, featuring a 9.1.4-channel configuration that\u2019s powered by 15 Class D amplifiers. That\u2019s a radical jump in drivers from the 5.0.2 arrangement seen on the original Sonos Arc. The specific arrangement combines seven tweeters, six midrange woofers, and a custom 'Sound Motion' woofer. The latter is particularly interesting as it works to improve low end performance using a custom motor design to let the driver move more air around. This is why Sonos claims the Arc Ultra can produce twice as much bass as its predecessor and a generally more balanced sound \u2013 two claims that after running the two head-to-head in our listening rooms we can confirm are true. During our tests the Arc Ultra delivered a clean, precise, spacious and three-dimensional sound with deep, tuneful and expressive low end.
