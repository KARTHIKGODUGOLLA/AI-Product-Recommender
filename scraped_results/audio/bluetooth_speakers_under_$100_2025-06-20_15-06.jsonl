You still need to spend a bit of money to get a high-quality listening experience, but plenty of sub-$100 entries pack a powerful audio punch. PCMag has been reviewing speakers for over two decades, so you can trust that our recommendations will fit your needs and budget, whether you want something for the outdoors , something that can handle your computer audio , or something that can also control your smart home devices. Our current Editors' Choice winners are the Anker Soundcore Motion 300, the Amazon Echo (4th Gen), and the Creative Pebble Pro, respectively, for their Alexa features, rugged design, and stereo separation\u2014and they all sound excellent. But you should still check out the rest of our picks to see if one fits your specific needs better, and scroll down past the list for some helpful buying advice. Deeper Dive: Our Top Tested Picks Best Smart Speaker Overall Pros & Cons As powerful as the Echo Plus Strong bass for the size Built-in smart home hub High frequencies don't get quite as much finesse as they could Alexa can still be awkward to talk to Why We Picked It The fourth-generation Amazon Echo is our favorite budget-friendly Alexa speaker. Its spherical enclosure houses dual tweeters and a 3-inch woofer, an impressive array in light of its compact size. Internally, Amazon's AZ1 Neural Edge processor improves speech recognition, while Zigbee compatibility enables you to control smart home devices. The device also supports HD playback from popular music streaming services and can make calls to other Alexa devices. Who It\u2019s For If you\u2019re in the market for an Echo speaker that costs less than $100, this is our top pick. Not many others on this list offer high-definition sound or as many smart home features. Specs & Configurations Channels Mono Physical Connections 3.5mm Built-In Voice Assistant Amazon Alexa Pros & Cons Good audio performance with wide stereo image Angled drivers for better audio delivery Built-in RGB lighting Support for 3.5mm, Bluetooth, and USB-C playback Affordable Limited Bluetooth codec support Separate adapter needed to plug directly into wall outlet Why We Picked It The Creative Pebble Pro speakers are, first and foremost, meant to handle audio from your laptop or desktop, but they also support Bluetooth for wireless music playback. Sonically, they are excellent, thanks to their angled drivers' crisp presentation. The customizable LEDs at the base of each speaker make for a fun design. Who It's For If you primarily want speakers for your computer but sometimes also want to play music from your phone, these speakers are a great value at well under $100. The two orbs produce a much wider soundstage than the compact, fully wireless alternatives on this list. Specs & Configurations Channels 2 Physical Connections USB-C, 3.5mm Built-In Voice Assistant None Pros & Cons Impressive power for its size Waterproof build Supports the LDAC codec Speakerphone Custom EQ in app Digital signal processing thins out bass at top volumes Why We Picked It Like most of Anker's products, the Soundcore Motion 300 outperforms its price. Its dual full-range drivers combine for 30W of power, while dual passive radiators help fill out the bass response for full stereo sound. We're also fans of the companion app's customizable EQ , a rarity in this price segment. An IPX7 waterproof rating, a decent speakerphone, and support for the AAC, LDAC, and SBC codecs complete the package. Who It\u2019s For Even if a nine-band EQ and the hi-res-capable LDAC codec seem like overkill, the Soundcore Motion 300 is still the best choice if you want control over how your budget-friendly speaker sounds. Specs & Configurations Channels Stereo Physical Connections USB-C Built-In Voice Assistant None Pros & Cons Rich, crisp, relatively powerful audio for the size Compact, easily portable design Fully waterproof Affordable No speakerphone Limited onboard controls Weak battery life Why We Picked It You should keep your expectations in check for a speaker that retails for under $50, but the tiny JBL Go 3 delivers more audio power than you might expect. It looks stylish and sporty, while a handy built-in lanyard lets you hang it from anything that can handle its 7.4-ounce weight. Who It\u2019s For If you want to listen to tunes while you go on outdoor adventures, the highly durable and very compact JBL Go 3 is a good choice. Specs & Configurations Channels Mono Physical Connections USB Built-In Voice Assistant None Pros & Cons Rich, crisp sound for its size Fully dust-tight and waterproof design Clear speakerphone mic No companion app Cheaper alternatives offer similar performance Why We Picked It The Sony SRS-XB100 produces robust sound for its size, and we like its IP67 build and stylish removable strap. Echo-canceling mics also make its built-in speakerphone very usable for hands-free calls. Who It\u2019s For It\u2019s not hard to imagine people who work from home taking the SRS-XB100", "url": "https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-bluetooth-speakers-under-100", "source": "pcmag.com", "price": "$100", "rating": ""}
