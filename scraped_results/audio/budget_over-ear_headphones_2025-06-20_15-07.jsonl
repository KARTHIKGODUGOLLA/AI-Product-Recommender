These lightweight, well-built headphones are a good option if you're looking for all-around casual use.", "full_text": "The best over-ear Bluetooth headphones under $100 for calls that we've tested are the JBL Tune 760NC. These headphones fluctuate in price, but if you can find them for under $100, they offer a better microphone performance than the other options listed here. The integrated mic makes your voice clear and natural and does a decent job of separating it from ambient sound, so distractions like traffic outside your window or a humming A/C unit won't disrupt calls very much. Their onboard controls allow you to answer and end calls without pulling out your phone. Unfortunately, their ANC feature doesn't have the best performance, so if you work in a busy office, you might prefer the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless , our top pick. They have a comfortable design but can feel tight, especially if you have a large head. The 760NC have a long continuous battery life of more than 40 hours, which is more than enough to get you through several workdays without recharging. They also have a balanced sound profile, with a mid-range that ensures voices are detailed and clear. That said, they lack companion software and customization features. If those options are important to you, consider the JBL Tune 770NC . The 770NC function very similarly to the 760NC and have an app that lets you customize their sound with a graphic EQ and presets. Unfortunately, the 770NC's microphone is a touch worse than the 760NC's. Still, on the whole, these two pairs of headphones perform comparably.", "url": "https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/best/over-ear-headphones-under-100", "source": "rtings.com", "price": "$100", "rating": ""}

For under $100, the JLab JBuds Lux are crazy good value Christian Thomas / SoundGuys The JBuds Lux is a compelling buy under $80.

The headphones provide decent active noise cancelation, effectively reducing low-frequency noise by 50-75% and isolating high-frequency noise by up to 46dB. While the ANC may not match more expensive models, it adequately handles daily commuting noise.

Battery life is impressive, with the headphones lasting over 44 hours on a single charge. Additionally, they support fast charging, providing 4 hours of listening time from a 10-minute charge.

Overall, the JLab JBuds Lux ANC delivers excellent value for budget-conscious consumers seeking over-ear headphones with solid noise cancelation, comfortable fit, and long battery life. While they may not have premium features like spatial audio or health sensors, they excel at the fundamentals What are the MDAQS results? The chart below shows how the sound of the JLab JBuds Lux ANC was assessed by the Multi-Dimensional Audio Quality Score ( MDAQS ) algorithm from HEAD acoustics. Christian Thomas / SoundGuys An overall mean option score of 4.5 points to a consumer-friendly sound with few unpleasant surprises. What is the frequency response? Here, we can see that the JLab JBuds Lux ANC have some bass emphasis \u2014 about 2-5dB over what we like to see \u2014 from 300Hz down to 20Hz . There\u2019s a little dip in the mids and then a large bump at 5-10kHz. This can help with spatial cues and sounds that typically get lost in mixes.

As far as inexpensive ANC headphones go, the JLab JBuds Lux ANC are one of the best of 2024. They focus on the fundamentals, and not fighting the spec wars. Best features on a budget: Edifier W830NB The W830NB offer a premium look from a distance. For those seeking high-end features without a high-end price tag, the Edifier W830NB stands out in the budget category. These headphones pack capabilities typically found in much more expensive models, including LDAC support for high-resolution audio streaming, multipoint connectivity for switching between devices, and audio over USB-C that lets you listen while charging. Sound quality is decent out of the box with a treble-leaning signature. Thankfully, the ConneX app provides a four-band parametric EQ that goes beyond the basic presets found in most budget headphones. Battery life is another standout feature, offering up to 54 hours of playback with ANC enabled and extending to 94 hours with it disabled. The active noise cancelation performs well against low-frequency sounds, making it suitable for commuting. The plastic construction reveals its budget nature with some creaks, but the plush ear cushions and balanced clamping force keep things comfortable for long listening sessions. While the lack of a carrying case and water resistance rating are notable omissions, the extensive feature set at under $80 makes these trade-offs easier to accept.

What is the frequency response? The Edifier W830NB aligns well with our preferred curve in the upper bass and lower mid-range. However, there\u2019s a noticeable spike in the high frequencies between 6.5kHz and 9kHz, which may be fatiguing for treble-sensitive listeners during longer sessions. The sub-bass response is slightly under our target.

{"title": "Best Over-Ear Headphones for 2025 - CNET", "summary": "Prefer headphones to earbuds? These are the best over-ear headphones, according to our CNET expert.", "full_text": "Shure Aonic 50 Gen 2 : A lot of us liked Shure's original Aonic 50 headphones, but they had pretty middling noise cancellation. Well, the 2nd-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours (they now have a quick-charge feature) and also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, although it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 a top noise-canceling headphone. The Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They feature excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure calls them a \"studio headphone,\" so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference). Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay HX : Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay HX headphones are the successor to the company's H9 series headphones (the X is the Roman numeral for 10) and, like those earlier H9 models, the HX headphones carry a list price of $599 (some colors are discounted at Amazon). That price makes it a direct competitor of Apple's AirPods Max, which is heavier at 385 grams versus the HX's 285 grams. I don't know if the HX headphones are more comfortable than the AirPods Max, but I found the two models pretty equal in the comfort department over longer listening sessions, and these do feature the usual swanky B&O lambskin-covered memory foam earpads. Their sound measures up well to the AirPods Max's sound -- overall, it's well-balanced, with deep, well-defined bass, natural-sounding mids (where vocals live) and inviting detail in the treble. V-Moda M-200 : V-Moda's M-200 is one of the few wired headphones on this list. Released in late 2019, these clean- and detailed-sounding over-ear headphones have excellent bass response, and the cushy earcups mean they're also comfortable to wear. Featuring 50mm drivers with neodymium magnets, CCAW voice coils and fine-tuning by Roland engineers -- yes, V-Moda is now owned by Roland -- the M\u2011200 is Hi\u2011Res Audio-certified by the Japan Audio Society. Other V-Moda headphones tend to push the bass a little, but this set has the more neutral profile that you'd expect from studio monitor headphones. They come with two cords, one of which has a built-in microphone for making calls. It would be nice if V-Moda offered Lightning or USB-C cables for phones without headphone jacks. Note that last year V-Moda released the M-200 ANC ($350), a wireless version of these headphones that includes active noise canceling. They also sound great, but their noise cancellation, call quality and overall feature set don't match those of the AirPods Max. Mark Levinson No. 5909 : These are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones and, yes, they're really expensive at $999. They're also really good. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy) and they're comfortable to wear over long periods, thanks to their nicely padded and replaceable leather-covered earcups and headband. Read our Mark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on . OneOdio A10 : The OneOdio A10s deliver more than you'd expect for their relatively modest price, which is why they're featured on several of our best lists. They're built better than you think they would be for around $90 and are pretty comfortable to wear. They have a dual-hinge design and feel sturdy, weighing in at 395 grams, making them perfect headphones for a workout . They sound surprisingly decent and have reasonably good noise canceling with a transparency mode (which has a slight audible hiss). The headphones also have very good battery life. No, they're not as comfortable as Bose's and Sony's models (they do feel a tad heavy) and their sound lacks that extra bit of clarity, bass definition and depth that more premium headphones tend to deliver. They did exceed my expectations and come with a decent carrying case, even if the OneOdio logo splayed across it is a bit garish. Technics EAH-A800 : There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800 -- and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback, but these headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic sound with powerful bass and good detail, although they take a day or two to break in.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-over-ear-headphones/", "source": "cnet.com", "price": "$300", "rating": ""}
