If I'm not mistaken iPhone 16 pro max supports up to 40W usbc and 20W in Magsafe, first of all correct me if I'm wrong and in case what I just said is right, why there is no 40W adaptor? The closest one is 35W, The 35W one is compatible with iPhone 16 pro max, right? Another question if I were to use an adapter with W greater than 40, would it damage the battery of iPhone 16 pro max ?", "url": "https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255751722", "source": "apple.com", "price": "", "rating": ""}

I'm looking at either the Anker 45w 713 Gan II charger, the Anker 65w 715 Gan II charger, or possible one of the Ugreen nexodes. My question is, if the iphone can charge up to 45w (maybe 39w at the high end in real performance?) should I just simply use a 45w charger or is it better to have headroom up to 65w?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1fgwbj2/best_usbc_charger_wattage_for_new_iphone_16/", "source": "reddit.com", "price": "", "rating": ""}
{"title": "The 8 Best USB-C Cables and Adapters for 2025 | Reviews by Wirecutter", "summary": "Although USB-C cables look similar, they\u2019re not one-size-fits-all. We have recommendations for every situation.", "full_text": "USB-C cables for charging phones, tablets, and laptops Lisen\u2019s 240W USB C to USB C Cable typically ranks high in Amazon search results due to its killer price of $8 for a pack of two, but while we appreciated its slim, woven design, it\u2019s missing an E-Marker chip, which helps safely negotiate power between device and charger. We also found errors with this cable\u2019s DC resistance, signal integrity, and continuity, and when we connected it to an M3 MacBook Pro via a power meter, the connection occasionally dropped off. The $30 Apple 240W USB-C Charge Cable offers luxuriously thick, woven braiding, but it\u2019s too bulky for phone charging and makes sense only for MacBooks. We found the Amazon Basics USB-C to USB-C 2.0 Fast Charger Cable too flimsy and the Cable Matters 240W USB-C Cable overly stiff. USB-C cables for transferring data and displaying video Anker\u2019s PowerLine II USB-C to USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 Cable couldn\u2019t match our pick in pricing, and the Amazon Basics USB-C to USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 Fast Charging Cable was overly stiff and offered only 60 W charging. We disqualified 20 Gbps data-transfer cables from Elfesoul and Rampow after finding significant DC-resistance and signal-integrity errors in our testing. USB-C cables with Thunderbolt 4 We appreciated the thick, woven braiding on the Apple Thunderbolt 4 Cable . But at $70, it\u2019s pricey for a short cable, and it doesn\u2019t support the 240 W charging that Apple\u2019s latest 16-inch MacBook Pro demands. Anker\u2019s USB-C to USB-C Thunderbolt 4 100W Cable couldn\u2019t match the value of our pick, and we preferred our pick\u2019s design over that of the Cable Matters Thunderbolt 4 Cable . The 6-foot Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Cable produced DC-resistance and continuity errors in our Total Phase tests, and the cost of active 6-foot Thunderbolt 4 cables is still considerably higher than that of 3-foot alternatives. Lightning\u2013to\u2013USB-C cables Apple\u2019s USB-C to Lightning Cable is thinner than the competition, but at $19 it\u2019s much pricier than our pick. The braided-nylon Amazon Basics USB-C to Lightning Charger Cable was slightly thicker and pricier than our pick. USB-C\u2013to\u2013USB-A cables We found one Jsaux USB C Cable to be overly thick and stiff. Our previous pick in this category, Belkin\u2019s BoostCharge USB-C Cable , couldn\u2019t match the value of our current winner. Three-in-one (USB-C, Micro-USB, Lightning) cables Anker\u2019s PowerLine II 3-in-1 Cable has the same length and pricing as our pick but lacks that model\u2019s clever attachment hooks for each adapter. We liked the idea behind Onlytang\u2019s 3-in-1 Multi Charging Cable , which splits off into three separate cables instead of using snap-on adapters, but our testing revealed errors with signal integrity, DC resistance, and continuity. DC-resistance errors also arose with the Kobilar 3 in 1 Cable we tested. USB-C\u2013to\u2013USB-A adapters The Amazon Basics USB Type-C to USB 3.1 Gen1 adapter has a slightly shorter cable than our pick and comes only as a single piece, not in a multi-pack. And while some folks may prefer an adapter with no extension cable, we found the Syntech USB C to USB Adapter too easy to lose, and the connection a tad too tight.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-cables/", "source": "nytimes.com", "price": "$500", "rating": ""}
