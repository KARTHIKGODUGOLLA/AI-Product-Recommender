{"title": "The 3 Best Power Banks for Laptops With USB-C in 2025 | Reviews by Wirecutter", "summary": "The Anker 747 PowerCore 26K is our favorite power bank for charging modern laptops as fast as possible while you\u2019re on the go\u2014no need to hunt for a power outlet.", "full_text": "Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter Best for... With a USB-C PD port, a DC port, two USB-A ports, and a wireless charging pad, this power bank has oodles of charging options. It doesn\u2019t come with a wall charger, but it\u2019s compact and has enough capacity to charge most laptops at least once. If you want the option to charge your laptop from a round DC port or to charge smaller devices wirelessly, opt for the Omnicharge Omni Mobile 25600 . It\u2019s about as lightweight and portable as our top pick, and it has a similar capacity rating. Although its output capabilities are less than stellar compared with our top pick, it lets you charge a wider variety of devices while you\u2019re on the go, offering USB-C PD, USB-A, DC, and wireless charging. It has a lower maximum output and input than our other picks. This model\u2019s single USB-C PD port has a maximum output of 60 W for charging other devices, and it can take a maximum input of 45 W when recharging itself. While neither wattage is optimal, that\u2019s still enough power to charge a professional-grade laptop like the 13-inch MacBook Pro M1 as fast as physically possible. Likewise, both of its 18 W USB-A ports have ample power to charge a Google Pixel 7 , a Nintendo Switch in handheld mode, or an iPhone 8 or newer . It offers charging options our other picks don\u2019t. These include a 10 W wireless charging pad with plenty of room to accommodate a phone, smartwatch, or other portable device with wireless-charging capabilities. It also has a 72 W DC input/output port to charge a laptop, digital camera, drone, or other compatible device, or to recharge the unit itself, with a compatible charging cord (not included). Even though most people are unlikely to already have such a cable on hand, this port is a nice-to-have feature if your laptop can take advantage of it, since the higher output from DC charges slightly faster than the USB-C PD port on this unit. It has plenty of battery capacity. This power bank\u2019s rated capacity (25,600 mAh, or about 92 Wh) matches that of our top pick, enabling it to bring most laptop batteries from empty to full at least once. The Omnicharge Omni Mobile 25600\u2019s slim shape makes it easy to stow in a backpack or briefcase, and at 1.2 pounds it\u2019s a hair lighter than our top pick. Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter The Omnicharge model is the only one of our picks with a wireless charging pad and a DC input/output port. Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter The Omnicharge Omni Mobile 25600\u2019s slim shape makes it easy to stow in a backpack or briefcase, and at 1.2 pounds it\u2019s a hair lighter than our top pick. Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter It\u2019s lightweight, slim, and easy to use. This power bank weighs even less than our top pick, at just 1.2 pounds. Its slim design makes it easy to slip into a bag for commuting or longer trips, and it has a sturdy build and a sleek appearance that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a boardroom or a bar. It\u2019s relatively easy to use, since all of its charging ports are on the same side, which also houses the power button and voltage indicator lights. It offers pass-through charging from its USB-A ports. You can charge up to three small devices via the USB-A ports\u2014or use the wireless charging pad\u2014while the power bank itself is recharging from either the USB-C port or the DC port (neither input port has pass-through charging capabilities). It\u2019s on the pricier side . Costing $149 at this writing, this model costs a bit more than our top pick. Also, fewer accessories come in the box (just a C-to-C cable and an A-to-C cable), and Omnicharge\u2019s one-year warranty is shorter than most. But if you want a wider variety of charging options, it\u2019s still a good value.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-battery-packs-and-power-banks/", "source": "nytimes.com", "price": "$500", "rating": ""}
