As Canon's most advanced entry-level DSLR, it's\u00a0a great option to get you started with photography.", "full_text": "While mirrorless cameras have overtaken the market in recent years, there's still a lot to love about the traditional DSLR, from an optical viewfinder to unrivaled battery performance to ergonomics that have defined the shooting experience for generations of photographers. You can also generally find DSLRs for cheaper, especially if you look for used options on eBay or at retailers like Adorama , B&H Photo Video , KEH Camera , and MPB . While it can be tempting to go right for a high-end model, it's important to get a handle on the basics when you're just starting out, so while we've included some newer cameras with more impressive feature sets, it's hard to go wrong with any DSLR released in the past several years, especially if you've never used a dedicated camera before. It's also worth noting that while the camera body matters, lenses will make the biggest difference in your photography. The standard kit lenses that most beginner DSLRs are bundled with are fine to start with, but if you're serious about improving the quality of your images, you'll want to save some room in your budget for lenses. We've bought and tested over 110 cameras, and below, you'll find the best DSLR cameras we've tested for beginners. If you're curious about mirrorless options, take a look at our picks for the best mirrorless cameras for beginners instead.

This is my guide what I've learned about DSLRs from experience, and fro\u2026", "full_text": "Introduction: A Beginners Guide to a DSLR Welcome all ye newbs, well maybe not, but anyway, here is my complete guide to a DSLR, whether your shooting in manual mode, or auto, you can probably learn something from this. This is my guide what I've learned about DSLRs from experience, and from being taught. Anyway, I like to experiment a lot with cameras, and I've been learning more, and getting better over the years. Practice and experience really does help a lot with this, at least in my case. A little bit about me... in photography... So, I have learned, over the years, I'm not to fond of many types of photography. I'm beyond terrible with taking pictures of people directly, for portraits, and telling them what to do, and how to act, I'm TERRIBLE at that (please note though: you might still be able to learn something still if your that kind of photographer), then, I find photographing just people as they are doing things in their everyday life (like a wedding photographer or something), kinda boring. I've delved into photography of rural and architectural places a little bit, and I've gone to Los Angeles to take pics, but it isn't my favorite. What I really like is things like sports photography, and nature photography, I like specifically taking pictures of surfing (being my favorite sport), but I love taking pictures of just the ocean, or other natural things. Something I really have wanted to get into is shorebreak photography, and in the water surf/ocean photography, unfortunately though, I haven't been able to get into that for the lack of a waterproof camera, I'm currently trying to get my hands on a Gopro, but haven't yet succeeded. Another thing to note, I love to experiment with different kinds of unique photographs, like low light, and I love to find cool new things to do with them. So, there's a little about my photography preferences, now for the camera stuff Step 1: Camera Basics Please Note: all cameras will be different, I am using a Cannon 20d and its layout might be different from yours, don't panic, it is all basically the same. PIcture 1: Camera (aka DSLR): stands for digital single-lens reflex, and is the main body of the setup, and what you take pictures with lens: This is the second part of the main body, it is what focuses and allows for zoom in the photo Picture 4: screen: This is the thing that displays the image for your reviewing/viewing pleasure, it is also how you navigate through the settings etc. Menu button: This is for getting to your main menu and this is also where you will go to access some of your settings Info button: You can press this button and it toggles what information you see on the screen from your pictures Jump/Skip button: This is the button you will use to navigate through your photos faster, you can skip 10 photos instead of going through every one Media/View pics button: This is the button you press to see all of your photos that you've shot Delete button: This is the button that you use to delete pictures that you don't want On/Off switch: This is the switch you use to toggle on or off, I'm not sure why, but my camera has three spots for you to slide to, there's off, on, and a line, from what I've figured out, you can only control your aperature while in the line mode, all others won't let you, again, don't know why it's there Ok button: for selecting ok when prompted/selection tool Scroll Wheel: This basically the main thing you use to get around the UI, it's how you navigate Joystick Thingy: This is for navigating around in a zoomed in pic, and selecting your point of focus Zoom in (on pics): This is for, when you are reviewing a picture that you've already taken, to zoom in closer on that picture Zoom out (on pics)/Focus point: This is for doing the opposite of Zoom in (on pics) (seen above) and also for selecting where you want your focus point to be when using auto focus (more on this later) View Finder: THIS IS WHERE YOU LOOK THROUGH WHEN TAKING A PICTURE. DSLRs are not like your smartphone camera or 'point and shoot' you aren't supposed to look at the screen while taking a pic (though there is a setting that allows for that) It is much, much, much more accurate to look through the viewfinder, and plus, it displays a lot more information on the bottom... Like the shutter speed and stuff Picture 5: Light setting: This is the setting that you select what kind of lighting conditions you are in, and the camera adjusts accordingly (AWB is auto mode) Battery: This displays how much juice you have left in your battery Scale: This is how the camera thinks your pictures should be, 0 is ideal, most of the time Shooting mode: Shows what shooting mode you are in (for example, single shot, repetition shots, or timer) (Approximated) images left: This is where the camera tells you about how many pictures you can still take before your sd card is full Aperture: This displays what your aperture is currently (more later) Shutter Speed: This displays your shutter spee", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/Complete-Beginners-guide-to-a-DSLR/", "source": "instructables.com", "price": "$125", "rating": ""}
{"title": "Best Entry-Level DSLRs of 2025 for Beginners, Ranked", "summary": "If you are wondering which entry-level DSLRs are among the best on the market today, we have compiled a detailed list with a lot of useful information.", "full_text": "Over the years of working for Photography Life, I\u2019ve had the chance to test almost every entry-level DSLR out there and review which ones are the best. Today, I\u2019d like to circle back and rank these cameras for photographers who are trying to decide on a DSLR, either for yourself or as a gift. Hopefully, this list gives you a good idea of which camera will be right for you. 2025 Update : Since this article was first published, almost every camera on the list below has changed in price, some more than others. I\u2019ve updated the rankings below accordingly, but if the prices are a bit different when you check (due to sales or general price changes) please take that into account. For a quick comparison, scroll down to the section called \u201cComplete Table\u201d to see all the specs and prices of these cameras in an easy-to-compare table format. DSLRs Versus Mirrorless Cameras The list below is only for DSLR cameras. You may have heard that these days, all camera companies (except for Pentax) only make mirrorless cameras. And even though that\u2019s true, a DSLR may still be the right choice for you. Simply put, the biggest difference between DSLRs and mirrorless cameras is the viewfinder. DSLRs have an optical \u201cthrough the lens\u201d viewfinder due to the internal mirror that reflects light into the viewfinder area. Mirrorless cameras either have an electronic viewfinder (basically a tiny LCD) or no viewfinder at all. Mirrorless cameras are usually lighter and smaller than DSLRs because it saves some space to remove the mirror and optical viewfinder. Mirrorless cameras are also getting more and more advanced as time goes by, while most companies are no longer making DSLRs. Yet a DSLR remains a great choice even in 2025, simply because DSLRs are selling for simply amazing prices, especially on the used market. DSLRs also have cheaper lens options because most people are selling them to move to mirrorless. Lenses are arguably even more important than the camera itself, so a DSLR paired with a good lens is arguably the best deal for camera equipment you\u2019ll find today. See more in our broader DSLR vs Mirrorless article. There\u2019s one major downside to a DSLR in 2025: it\u2019s very hard to find a new one, and used models are aging. The one exception is Pentax, although their development cycle is a little slow. So even though a used DSLR might still be an amazing value, just keep in mind you\u2019ll have to pay extra attention to the state of used equipment if you go the DSLR route. Don\u2019t get that scare you though: an entry-level DSLR is still the best way to get high-quality imagery for a rock-bottom price. What Counts as an Entry-Level DSLR? My first DSLR was the Nikon D5100, which is almost the definition of entry-level. But when I heard people actually call it entry-level, I was taken aback. It was a good camera! I had saved money and spent a lot of hours researching which one to buy, but professional photographers nonetheless dismissed it as \u201cconsumer\u201d or \u201camateur.\u201d The few times I heard people call the D5100 a prosumer camera, I nodded in agreement. And prosumer is a ridiculous word. Nikon D5100 + 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 @ 32mm, ISO 100, 6 seconds, f/22.0 That\u2019s my way of saying that the cameras on this list are still really good, even though the title of the article says \u201centry-level.\u201d The category of the camera doesn\u2019t determine the category of the photographer. Besides, I stretched the definition a bit just because I wanted to do a great top-10 list and needed to reach the quota. Other than a few older or obsolete DSLRs that are still sold new for some reason, this guide includes every current entry-level DSLR on the market; it\u2019s the most comprehensive list you\u2019ll find anywhere today. In total, I\u2019ve ranked six DSLRs from Canon, two from Nikon, and two from Pentax. The overwhelming number of Canon cameras is simply because Canon\u2019s lineup has more entry-level DSLRs. It\u2019s not a sign of Canon favoritism (and you might notice that the bottom spot belongs to Canon, whoops). In fact, one camera from each manufacturer makes it to the top three. I didn\u2019t plan that ahead of time, but it\u2019s a pretty nice sign that each company is competitive in this space. Last, I have to mention my (somewhat boring) takeaway after testing several entry-level cameras last year: They\u2019re all very similar in quality, without any real duds among them. The difference between the best and worst cameras on the list below is surprisingly small. Your individual needs \u2013 say, a desire to shoot video more than stills \u2013 could shift where each camera falls for you, perhaps significantly. Don\u2019t Buy the Bundle Before jumping into the rankings below, take just a moment to heed a quick warning: Don\u2019t buy that all-purpose photography bundle! Most of the cameras in this article, due to their price range, are targeted largely at first-time DSLR buyers. As a result, you can buy most of them as a bundle with lots of extra photography accessories.
