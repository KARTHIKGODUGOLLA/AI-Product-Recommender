{"title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "summary": "", "full_text": "( Hey, this is one of my first few Reddit posts so if I don't send this information correctly sorry!! ) So, I had a question I have the Canon m50 MK II with the Kit lens and I do enjoy the camera a lot but I just don't know if I should switch. I've rented out the Sigma 16mm for the Canon and it ws very good i'll link it below. But, I'm stuck between either A. buying a whole new camera or B. Just upgrading the lens . (btw I do have an attachment light and I feel like it still isn't good enough) I'm having this debate mainly I guess you could say due to a low light problem with my lens and I don't know if I should spend the 300 on getting the lens or just saving up to buy a whole new camera that could be better than mine with a whole new lens that could be better than mine This is the video of me at night time and how I usually shoot Video without Sigma Lens and this is the video of night time With Sigma Lens I'm doing all this to avoid the noise in my videos when I edit and because a lot of people gave feedback saying they cannot see well with my car vlogs.
