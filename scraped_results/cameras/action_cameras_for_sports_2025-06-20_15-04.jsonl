{"title": "The 3 Best Action Cameras of 2025 | Reviews by Wirecutter", "summary": "If you want to take photos and videos in any situation, even extreme weather, the GoPro Hero13 Black is the best option for most people.", "full_text": "Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter Top pick This camera\u2019s impressive image quality and super-steady stabilization are unmatched, and it\u2019s especially easy to use. The GoPro Hero13 Black is the ultimate action camera, offering the highest-quality video we\u2019ve seen in the category. Its tall image sensor lets you easily create vertical videos for Instagram Stories and TikTok, but with its high resolution, it can still capture horizontal videos for YouTube. The standard 0.25-inch mount lets you attach the Hero13 Black to any traditional camera mount or tripod, and it\u2019s compatible with new easy-release magnetic mounts. The Hero13 Black has longer run times than its predecessor thanks to its larger battery, yet it also includes GPS, which previous cameras lacked. Optional lenses, including an ultra wide-angle, a macro, multiple neutral density filters, and an anamorphic lens, greatly increase the types of videos you can capture. It offers the best image quality we\u2019ve seen from an action camera. The Hero13 Black can record 5.3K video at a smooth 60 frames per second. Footage looks razor-sharp and vibrant, with smooth transitions between colors and no banding. Thanks to its extremely high bit rate of 120 Mbps, it minimizes video noise and keeps the detail high during fast motion. If you don\u2019t need that level of detail, the Hero13 Black also offers 4K recording at 120 fps, and for ultra-smooth slow motion, 2.7K-resolution video at up to 240 fps is possible. A burst slo-mo mode even allows you to capture several minutes of 720p video at 400 fps or 20 seconds of 5.3K video at 120 fps. In addition, the Hero13 Black accommodates HDR video shooting up to 5.3K at 30 fps for high dynamic range situations, such as at sunset or in canyons. It even has HLG (hybrid log\u2013gamma) support for professionals. The Hero13 Black\u2019s optional simplified menus make it easy for beginners to get started quickly. Geoffrey Morrison for NYT Wirecutter The Hero13 Black accommodates HDR video capture up to 5.3K at 30 fps for high dynamic range situations. Geoffrey Morrison for NYT Wirecutter The Hero13 Black\u2019s optional simplified menus make it easy for beginners to get started quickly. Geoffrey Morrison for NYT Wirecutter It\u2019s rugged. The Hero13 Black is waterproof to a depth of 10 meters (33 feet). The lens cover is 2-millimeter-thick Gorilla Glass (the same material used for many phone screens) with a hydrophobic coating to reduce the chance of water beading on it when the camera is splashed. And if you manage to scratch this lens, it\u2019s replaceable. It has the longest run time we\u2019ve seen from a GoPro camera. Thanks to a new, larger battery, GoPro claims, the Hero13 Black is good for up to 79 minutes of continuous recording at 5.3K 60 fps \u2014 13% longer than what the company claimed for the Hero12 Black. That roughly aligned with our testing results, though many variables will affect real-world run times. You might get more, or less, depending on factors such as ambient temperature and ventilation. Lower resolutions and frame rates can greatly increase run times, while direct sun can reduce them. And if you\u2019re recording at max settings, your Hero13 Black is likely to overheat long before its battery runs out. Bear in mind that this new battery is physically larger than the Hero12 Black\u2019s battery, so if you have an older camera and you\u2019re upgrading, your existing batteries won\u2019t fit. Creating videos for social media is a snap. The Hero13 Black\u2019s image sensor has a nearly square 8:7 aspect ratio instead of the typical rectangular 16:9. This makes creating a mix of vertical (for TikTok or Instagram Stories) and horizontal (for YouTube) content easier, since you can record using the full sensor area and then crop the footage in the GoPro Quik app to vertical or horizontal as you desire without reducing the resolution and quality. Other cameras sacrifice the quality of one orientation for the other or require you to physically rotate the camera to maintain quality, which is not always possible depending on your mount or situation. Beginners will find it easy to use. This camera\u2019s optional simplified menus help novices figure out the various modes better than those of other cameras we\u2019ve tried. Experienced users can switch to menus that are more in-depth but still easy to navigate. Like most new action cameras, the Hero13 Black also offers optional voice control, in this case supporting 11 languages and six accents. Its stabilization is impressively effective. GoPro\u2019s latest stabilization processing, which it calls HyperSmooth 6.0, is capable of locking the horizon to level even if you rotate the camera 360 degrees. Videos remain smooth even during strong vibrations. Most action cameras, regardless of brand, have solid stabilization these days, but in our testing the Hero13 Black seemed a little better than competitors and previous GoPro models in this regard. GoPro is everywhere. One of the main reasons we like GoPro cameras is their near-ubiquity.
