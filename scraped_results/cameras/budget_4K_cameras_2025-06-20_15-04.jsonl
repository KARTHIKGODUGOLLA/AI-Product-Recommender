If we had to pick just one 4K camera to shoot with, it would be the Panasonic Lumix GH7 . In on our experience, its Four Thirds sensor hits the sweet spot between portability and performance. Blessed with a range of pro-friendly features and an arsenal of cinematic 5.7K modes, we think it offers great value overall. That said, you might find a better fit in our list.
